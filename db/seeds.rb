# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#seed database with Categories

# auto = Category.create(name: "Auto & Transportation")
# utilities = Category.create(name: "Bills & Utilities")
# entertainment = Category.create(name: "Entertainment")
# food = Category.create(name: "Food & Dining")
# donations = Category.create(name: "Gifts & Donations")
# miscellaneous = Category.create(name: "Miscellaneous")
# shopping = Category.create(name: "Shopping")
# travel = Category.create(name: "Travel")
# savings = Category.create(name: "Savings")
